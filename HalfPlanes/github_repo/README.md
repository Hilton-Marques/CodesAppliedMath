The `LaTeX` needed looks like:

```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{media9}

\begin{document}
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includemedia[
			width=0.8\textwidth,
			activate=pagevisible,
			%deactivate=pageinvisible,
			3Dtoolbar,
			3Dviews=./example_supercyclide.vws
		]{
			\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{example_supercyclide.pdf}
		}{./example_supercyclide.u3d}
		\caption{An implicitly defined elliptic supercyclide.}
		\label{fig:example_supercyclide}
	\end{figure}
\end{document}
```

## Description
`fig2u3d` saves the figure as a `U3D` file for inclusion as an interactive 3-dimensional figure within a `PDF`. Either `LaTeX` or Adobe Acrobat can be used to embed the `U3D` file in the `PDF`.

The `idtf2u3d` executables are included from [this project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/u3d/) (see dependencies below).

A `vws` file is also created, which contains the current camera view of the axes saved. This file can be used to set the figure's default view in the PDF to be the same with the open figure window in `MATLAB`.

The [media9](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/media9) LaTeX package can import U3D files with their associated VWS files in a PDF document.

For PDF readers which do not render 3D figures, it is possible to include an alternative 2D image as a substitute to the 3D object. For conveniency, the script saves a 2D image together with U3D file. File type and other options for exporting this 2D image can be specified as additional arguments.

`fig2pdf3d` Converts the figure directly to a PDF containing only an interactive 3D graphics object.

Graphics object supported for export include:

- line
- surface
- patch
- quivergroup
- contourgroup

Line colors and marker styles, surfaces and `quivers` with `NaN`s and surface shading are supported. Multiple instances of various objects can be plotted in the same axes and exported. Note that some limitations apply, for example filled contours are not yet supported.

## Installation

Download & unpack from the [release](https://github.com/johnyf/fig2u3d/releases) the:

- `MATLAB` code,
- idtf2u3d converter Mac OS X, Linux, Windows binaries, place this under `idtf2u3d/bin` (result: `idtf2u3d/bin/glxâ€¦` etc),
- required `MATLAB` packages, place them anywhere.

Add all the above and their subdirectories to your `MATLAB` path, e.g. using the `pathtool` command.

### Optional
- `fig2pdf3d` needs a latex distribution (e.g. [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/), [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/)) and [`media9`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/media9) (preferred) or [`movie15`](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/movie15) LaTeX package (replaced by `media9`).
